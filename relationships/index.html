We'd lock <a opens="5">eyes</a><span class="off" openby="5"> and I would walk <a opens="6">over</a><span class="off" openby="6"> and say <a opens="7">hello</a></span></span>.</span></p>

	<p><span class="off" openby="8">I'd suggest that we sit down and catch-up. You look like you have <a opens="10">somewhere</a> to go<span class="off" openby="10">, but you say decide <a opens="11">stay</a></span>.</span></p>
